# dotfiles - my files with the .

This is the configuration I use day by day on my Mac and Linux machines at work.

Feel free to use it and improve it.

## Usage

Clone the repository to

    ~/dotfiles

and run

    ~/dotfiles/install.sh

## Extending

The installer is a bash script. You can configure arrays to tell which files/directories to skip or which not to prefix with a dot.  
Nice, eh?
